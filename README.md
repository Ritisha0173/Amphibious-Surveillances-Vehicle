# Amphibious-Surveillances-Vehicle
# Problem Statement

Border surveillance demands continuous monitoring of vast and often inaccessible terrains where manual patrolling is time-consuming, risky, and resource-intensive. Traditional CCTV systems and static sensors fail to provide mobility and real-time situational awareness across large border zones. Hence, there is a need for an autonomous surveillance system that can operate efficiently in these challenging environments.

# Objective

To design and develop an Autonomous Border Surveillance Vehicle capable of patrolling restricted areas with minimal human intervention. The vehicle will integrate sensors, cameras, GPS, and IoT-based control to perform real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, and data transmission, ensuring enhanced border security and situational intelligence.

# Novelty

The proposed system introduces a fully autonomous, terrain-adaptive vehicle equipped with AI-based object detection, IoT-enabled remote monitoring, and night-vision surveillance. Unlike conventional stationary systems, this design provides continuous mobility, self-navigation, and automated threat alerts, making it a cost-effective and intelligent alternative for border security operations.
